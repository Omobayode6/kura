            <h4>Kura Student Ambassador Program:</h4>
            <p>Kura Student Ambassador Programme (KSAP) is designed for Kura to partner with substantive students in universities, colleges, schools, and polytechnics as Kura representatives and ambassadors, and carry our vision and shared value in their communities and beyond. As a Kura Ambassador your primary role is to push the idea of Kura in your community and school/schools using all  responsible channels approved by Kura.</p><br>
            <div>
              <h4>What is the job of a Kura Student Ambassador?</h4>
              <p>Our product is dominantly designed for students, and we will rely heavily on our Student Ambassadors, who come from a variety of courses, entry pathways, levels, schools, and backgrounds. Our student ambassador must have a strong influence, personable and good social skills. This defines who we work with, as they need those qualities to connect with other school students, share their experiences, and encourage them to pursue university study and find resources via Kura App.</p>
              <p>This role requires you to engage with school students, answer questions and talk about our journey and product (Kura App) throughout responsible channels in your school, communities and beyond.</p>
              <p> You will be responsible for connecting with prospective students and ensuring they are supported through the use and navigation of Kura app. This may include guiding users and groups on campus, assisting with a variety of Kura events, delivering presentations on behalf of Kura, and running hands-on school campaigns and workshops for Kura.</p>
